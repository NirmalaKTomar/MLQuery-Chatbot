            "machine learning involves computers discovering how they can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. for early tasks that humans assigned to computers, it was possible to create algorithms telling the machine how to execute all needed steps to solve the problem in hand. so on the computer's part, no learning was needed. for more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms. in practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than have human programmers specify every needed step.[6][7]\n",

[9][10] a representative book of the machine learning research during the 1960s was the nilsson's book on learning machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.[11] interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by duda and hart in 1973. [12] in 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.

            "machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ecml pkdd being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (kdd) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical kdd task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. \n",
